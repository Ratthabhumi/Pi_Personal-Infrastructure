## 📌 Vision & Philosophy
This repository serves as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** for deploying, maintaining, monitoring, and scaling a personal cloud and Artificial Intelligence infrastructure. 

> 🎉 **Update (August 2026): PHASE 1 COMPLETED & HOMEPAGE DEPLOYED**
> The infrastructure has been successfully deployed as a highly optimized, lightweight Docker Compose stack, tailor-made to run efficiently on an Acer Aspire V13 (4GB RAM). Features include a Zero-Trust Tailscale network, UFW firewall, automated self-hosted CI/CD via GitHub Actions, and an expansive self-hosted application suite (Vaultwarden, AdGuard, Grafana, Homepage Dashboard). We also implemented advanced storage management (LVM Expansion) and automated GitOps rolling updates (`--pull always`). Phase 2 (Kubernetes & Local LLMs) is currently on hold pending a hardware upgrade (16GB+ RAM recommended).

We strictly abide by modern **DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and Platform Engineering** practices:
1. **Cattle, Not Pets**: Servers and configurations are completely modular, automated, and ephemeral. Should any compute instance fail, rebuilding it takes minutes via code.
2. **Zero-Trust Security**: No assumptions are made regarding local area networks; we enforce least-privilege, encrypted network overlays (Tailscale), and robust secrets management.
3. **Observability Driven Development (ODD)**: Every running container, service, and automation workflow explicitly outputs diagnostics, logs, and telemetry.
4. **Autonomous Agent Ready**: Structured clean to enable LLM agents to monitor, debug, self-heal, and dynamically document infrastructure states.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Developer Ergonomics)

We provide a specialized `Makefile` interface to streamline complex shell operations:

```bash
# Verify tooling, dependencies, and lint repository syntax
make check

# View active targets and running cluster status
make status

# Deploy core foundational Docker network and Traefik router on 'homelab'
make deploy-core
```

## 🔒 Security & Secrets Warning
**NEVER** commit plain-text passwords, SSH private keys, tokens, or `.env` files directly into this repository. All confidential parameters must rely on encrypted structures (such as SOPS, HashiCorp Vault, or strict Git-excluded templates).
