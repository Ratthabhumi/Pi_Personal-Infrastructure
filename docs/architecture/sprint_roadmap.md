# Platform Engineering & AI Infrastructure: Agile Sprint Roadmap

This document defines our evolutionary execution plan to transform an entry-level home setup into an enterprise-grade AI Cloud infrastructure using progressive Platform Engineering sprints.

## 🧭 Architectural Dependency Flow (Why Order Matters)
In modern Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), deploying application containers before automating the operating system and networking ingress leads to unmanageable Technical Debt. We follow a strict foundational execution pipeline:

```
[ Sprint 1: OS Automation & Hardening (Ansible) ]
                     │
                     ▼
[ Sprint 2: Edge Gateway & Zero-Trust Routing (Traefik + Tailscale DNS) ]
                     │
                     ▼
[ Sprint 3: Full Observability Telemetry & Logging (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki) ]
                     │
                     ▼
[ Sprint 4: SRE Autonomous Agents & Self-Documenting Scripts (Python + AI) ]
                     │
                     ▼
[ Sprint 5: Distributed AI Inference Engine (60k THB Build + GPU Mesh) ]
```
