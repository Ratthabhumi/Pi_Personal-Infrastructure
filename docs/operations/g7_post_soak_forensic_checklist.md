> [!CAUTION]
> ### STRICT READ-ONLY POST-SOAK INVARIANTS
> - **DO NOT EXECUTE WHILE SOAK IS ACTIVE:** This checklist is designed for use **strictly after** the active Gate 7 (G7) soak run has terminated. Running these commands against an active soak risks perturbing socket telemetry, timing, and evidence generation.
> - **STRICT FAIL-CLOSED READ-ONLY INSPECTION:** All inspection commands are strictly read-only. Never restart containers, never stop containers, never reload Docker, never remove evidence, and never alter file modes (`chmod` / `chown`).
> - **NON-RETROACTIVITY OF CODE PATCHES:** A source-code patch committed after process start does not retroactively change already-running shell state, already-resolved variables, or historical monitoring behavior. Runtime evidence and harness validity must be evaluated separately.
> - **CANONICAL DISTINCTION TRINITY:**
>   $$\text{Physical Runtime Continuity} \neq \text{Canonical Harness Validity} \neq \text{Human Acceptance}$$
> - **NO ADHOC GOVERNANCE INVENTION:** This document is a non-governing operational runbook. It consumes existing canonical verification logic (`verify_g7_evidence.sh`); it has zero authority to add, remove, or modify acceptance criteria or Stage 11 gates.

## 1. Executive Summary & Objective

Gate 7 (`G7`) and Stage 11 (`S11`) validate the operational resilience, continuous feed stability, session journaling, and cryptographic evidence sealing of the ACASH execution runtime under a continuous 6-hour soak test.

The objective of this forensic checklist is to:
1. Provide a rigorous, step-by-step, read-only audit protocol to verify soak evidence immediately upon completion.
2. Formulate explicit criteria distinguishing physical container continuity from harness session-binding correctness.
3. Diagnose potential host-filesystem unreadability using permission-safe containerized tooling without mutating file ownership.
4. Record authoritative verification output from canonical verification scripts without adding unratified governance gates.

---

## 2. Forensic Inspection Workflow Overview

The post-soak audit proceeds through eight discrete verification gates:

## 3. Section-by-Section Forensic Audit Protocol

### 3.1 Container Identity & Environment Audit
Record the exact container runtime parameters from the host Docker daemon:

- **Target Container Name:** `acash-staging` (or session-specific override)
- **Fields to Extract:**
  - `container_id`: Full 64-character SHA-256 container ID.
  - `image_id`: Full image digest.
  - `image_tag`: Local image tag (e.g. `acash:e36-ws10-staging`).
  - `container_started_at`: Exact ISO-8601 start timestamp (`.State.StartedAt`).
  - `container_finished_at`: Exact ISO-8601 finish timestamp (`.State.FinishedAt`).
  - `exit_code`: Final process exit code (`.State.ExitCode`).
  - `restart_count`: Number of unexpected container restarts (`.RestartCount`).
  - `oom_killed`: Kernel out-of-memory kill flag (`.State.OOMKilled`).
  - `pid`: Host process PID.
  - `git_commit_pi`: Git commit of `Pi_Personal-Infrastructure` at launch.
  - `git_commit_acash`: Git commit of `Acash` runtime image at launch.

#### Read-Only Inspection Command:
```bash
docker inspect acash-staging --format '{{json .}}' | python3 -c '
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
state = data["State"]
cfg = data["Config"]
host_cfg = data["HostConfig"]
print("=== CONTAINER IDENTITY ===")
c_id = data.get("Id", "N/A")
img_id = data.get("Image", "N/A")
img_tag = cfg.get("Image", "N/A")
started = state.get("StartedAt", "N/A")
finished = state.get("FinishedAt", "N/A")
exit_code = state.get("ExitCode", "N/A")
restarts = data.get("RestartCount", 0)
oom = state.get("OOMKilled", False)
user = cfg.get("User", "N/A")
policy = host_cfg.get("RestartPolicy", {}).get("Name", "N/A")
readonly = host_cfg.get("ReadonlyRootfs", False)

print(f"Container ID:     {c_id}")
print(f"Image ID:         {img_id}")
print(f"Image Tag:        {img_tag}")
print(f"StartedAt:        {started}")
print(f"FinishedAt:       {finished}")
print(f"ExitCode:         {exit_code}")
print(f"RestartCount:     {restarts}")
print(f"OOMKilled:        {oom}")
print(f"User:             {user}")
print(f"RestartPolicy:    {policy}")
print(f"ReadonlyRootfs:   {readonly} (Informational)")
'
```

---

### 3.2 Duration & Continuity Verification
Verify that the soak satisfies the minimum continuous operational duration without interruption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DISCRETE DURATION METRICS:** The auditor must distinguish between four separate time intervals that are not automatically identical:
> 1. **Container Runtime Duration:** Wall-clock delta between container start and container stop.
> 2. **Session Journal Duration:** Delta between `SESSION_STARTED` and final journal event.
> 3. **Market Bar Coverage:** Delta between first received M1 bar timestamp and last received M1 bar.
> 4. **Harness Timer Duration:** Elapsed time recorded by the host `execute_g7_soak.sh` wrapper script.

- **Canonical Minimum Requirement:** $\ge 21,600$ continuous seconds ($6.00$ hours).
- **Restart Invariant:** `RestartCount == 0`. Any container restart resets the continuous clock to zero.

#### Read-Only Duration Calculation Command:
```bash
python3 -c '
from datetime import datetime
started_str = "<CONTAINER_STARTED_AT>" # e.g. 2026-09-13T02:51:17.123456Z
finished_str = "<CONTAINER_FINISHED_AT>"
t0 = datetime.fromisoformat(started_str.replace("Z", "+00:00"))
t1 = datetime.fromisoformat(finished_str.replace("Z", "+00:00")) if finished_str != "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z" else datetime.now(t0.tzinfo)
elapsed = (t1 - t0).total_seconds()
print(f"Continuous Wall-Clock Seconds: {elapsed:.2f} s ({elapsed/3600:.3f} h)")
assert elapsed >= 21600.0, f"Duration violation: {elapsed} < 21600s"
'
```

---

### 3.3 Authoritative Event & Disconnect Ledger
The session journal (`.journal.jsonl`) is the single source of truth for runtime events.

- **Required Event Checks:**
  - First event must be `SESSION_STARTED` with matching `session_id`.
  - Count total `FEED_CONNECTED` events.
  - Count total `FEED_DISCONNECTED` events.
  - If `FEED_DISCONNECTED` occurs:
    - Extract exact timestamps of all disconnects.
    - Check whether disconnect was resolved by operator recovery or resulted in terminal disconnect.
    - Verify that no auto-reconnect occurred (must remain fail-closed).
  - Terminal state must be clean shutdown or active wait (not unexpected socket crash).

#### Permission-Safe Read-Only Command:
```bash
# Execute within read-only container mount to bypass host permission boundaries
STORAGE_ROOT="${ACASH_STORAGE_ROOT:-/data/docker/acash}"
SESSIONS_DIR="${STORAGE_ROOT}/sessions"
ACASH_IMAGE="acash:e36-ws10-staging"
SESSION_ID="<SESSION_ID>"

docker run --rm \
    --user 10001:10001 \
    -v "${STORAGE_ROOT}:${STORAGE_ROOT}:ro" \
    --entrypoint python \
    "${ACASH_IMAGE}" \
    -c '
import sys, json

journal_path = sys.argv[1]

events = []
feed_connected = 0
feed_disconnected = 0
disconnect_log = []

with open(journal_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line_idx, line in enumerate(f, 1):
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
        try:
            ev = json.loads(line)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[CORRUPT] Malformed JSON line {line_idx}: {e}")
            sys.exit(1)

        etype = ev.get("event_type")
        events.append(etype)
        if etype == "FEED_CONNECTED":
            feed_connected += 1
        elif etype == "FEED_DISCONNECTED":
            feed_disconnected += 1
            disconnect_log.append(ev)

print(f"Total Events:          {len(events)}")
print(f"FEED_CONNECTED Count:  {feed_connected}")
print(f"FEED_DISCONNECTED:     {feed_disconnected}")
if disconnect_log:
    print("=== DISCONNECT CHRONOLOGY ===")
    for d in disconnect_log:
        t_val = d.get("event_time_utc") or d.get("recorded_at_utc")
        payload = d.get("payload") or {}
        r_val = payload.get("reason", "N/A")
        print(f"  Time: {t_val}, Reason: {r_val}")
' "${SESSIONS_DIR}/${SESSION_ID}.journal.jsonl"
```

---

### 3.4 Market Data Bar Monotonicity & Cadence (Canonical Event: `MARKET_BAR_RECEIVED`)
Audit all M1 bars recorded during the session for timestamp ordering, duplication, and missing windows using the canonical event type `MARKET_BAR_RECEIVED`.

- **Metrics to Compute:**
  - `total_bars`: Count of discrete `MARKET_BAR_RECEIVED` events ingested.
  - `first_bar_utc` & `last_bar_utc`: First and last bar timestamps.
  - `duplicate_timestamps`: Count of duplicate bar timestamps (must be 0).
  - `out_of_order_bars`: Count of non-monotonic timestamps (must be 0).
  - `unexpected_gaps`: Minutes where no bar was emitted during active feed connection.
  - `largest_gap_minutes`: Maximum duration between consecutive bars.

> [!NOTE]
> **GAP SEMANTICS INVARIANT:** For M1 feeds, a missing minute is not automatically an engine defect. In thin instruments or illiquid periods, zero trades produce zero bars. However, for `BTCUSDT` on Binance, trading occurs in 100% of minutes under normal operation. Any gap $\ge 2$ minutes must be cross-checked against exchange maintenance records or socket disconnect events.

#### Permission-Safe Read-Only Command:
```bash
docker run --rm \
    --user 10001:10001 \
    -v "${STORAGE_ROOT}:${STORAGE_ROOT}:ro" \
    --entrypoint python \
    "${ACASH_IMAGE}" \
    -c '
import sys, json
from datetime import datetime

journal_path = sys.argv[1]

bar_times = []
with open(journal_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    for line in f:
        ev = json.loads(line)
        if ev.get("event_type") == "MARKET_BAR_RECEIVED":
            t_str = ev.get("payload", {}).get("timestamp_utc") or ev.get("event_time_utc")
            if t_str:
                bar_times.append(datetime.fromisoformat(t_str.replace("Z", "+00:00")))

print(f"Total Bars (MARKET_BAR_RECEIVED): {len(bar_times)}")
if bar_times:
    print(f"First Bar UTC:       {bar_times[0]}")
    print(f"Last Bar UTC:        {bar_times[-1]}")

    dups = len(bar_times) - len(set(bar_times))
    print(f"Duplicate Bars:      {dups}")

    out_of_order = sum(1 for i in range(len(bar_times)-1) if bar_times[i] >= bar_times[i+1])
    print(f"Out-of-Order Bars:   {out_of_order}")
' "${SESSIONS_DIR}/${SESSION_ID}.journal.jsonl"
```

---

### 3.5 Cryptographic Evidence Sealing & Hash Integrity
Gate G7 produces three mandatory evidence artifacts:
1. `${SESSION_ID}.journal.jsonl`: Authoritative event stream.
2. `${SESSION_ID}.manifest.json`: Execution manifest with canonical hash bindings.
3. `${SESSION_ID}.snapshots.jsonl`: Periodic and terminal state snapshots (JSON Lines).

- **Verification Invariants:**
  - All three files must exist and have non-zero size (`-s`).
  - `manifest.json` must contain `journal_final_hash` matching the hash of the last committed event in `${SESSION_ID}.journal.jsonl`.
  - `manifest.json` must contain `manifest_hash` and `sealed_at_utc`.
  - `${SESSION_ID}.snapshots.jsonl` must contain valid JSONL lines with snapshot identifiers.
  - Session IDs across all three files must be byte-for-byte identical.
  - File permissions must conform to non-root least privilege (`10001:10001`), with no unexpected world-writable bits.

> [!CAUTION]
> **LEAST-PRIVILEGE PERMISSION DISCIPLINE:** If host commands return permission denied when reading evidence, classify this status as **`HOST UNREADABLE`**, NOT as missing. Never execute `chmod` or `chown` against production or soak storage. Use the containerized read-only inspection pattern (`-v ...:ro`).

#### Canonical Tooling Verification Command (Preferred):
```bash
# Prefer canonical acash.paper integrity and review tooling over custom hash scripts
docker run --rm \
    --user 10001:10001 \
    -v "${STORAGE_ROOT}:${STORAGE_ROOT}:ro" \
    "${ACASH_IMAGE}" \
    integrity \
    --session-id "${SESSION_ID}" \
    --storage "${SESSIONS_DIR}"

docker run --rm \
    --user 10001:10001 \
    -v "${STORAGE_ROOT}:${STORAGE_ROOT}:ro" \
    "${ACASH_IMAGE}" \
    review \
    --session-id "${SESSION_ID}" \
    --storage "${SESSIONS_DIR}"
```

---

### 3.6 Security & Governance Boundary Audit
Verify that the runtime executed within strict sandboxed limits:

- `NO_REAL_ORDERS == true` (enforced in environment & attested in manifest).
- `capital == $0.00` (synthetic paper state only; zero trading capital).
- `paper_authorized == false` (operational soak only; not paper trading).
- `live_locked == true` (execution completely disabled).
- `operator_only_recovery == true` (zero autonomous reconnect attempts).
- Security options: verify `no-new-privileges:true`.
- Exposed ports: verify zero public ports published (`.NetworkSettings.Ports` empty or localhost only).
- Order semantics: `no_real_orders=true` is attested by the manifest. Paper infrastructure may contain simulated order events; simulated orders are not real broker orders. Report simulated order count informationally.

---

### 3.7 Harness Session Binding Audit
Audit whether the host harness correctly bound to the runtime session ID.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **HARNESS RESOLUTION CONTRACT:**
> - Record the `SESSION_ID` resolved by the host harness at launch.
> - Record the actual runtime `SESSION_ID` generated by the container.
> - Record the target `SESSION_ID` queried by `g7.sh status` during monitoring.
> - Record the `SESSION_ID` targeted by `verify_g7_evidence.sh` at completion.
>
> **Classification Rules:**
> - `BOUND_CORRECTLY`: Harness resolved ID $\equiv$ Container ID $\equiv$ Journal ID $\equiv$ Verifier ID.
> - `MISMATCHED`: Harness targeted a different session ID than the container generated.
> - `UNRESOLVED`: Harness defaulted to `unknown` or empty string during execution.
> - `UNAVAILABLE`: Host filesystem permissions prevented harness from reading session artifacts.
>
> If harness binding fails: Record `DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE PRESERVED; CANONICAL ELIGIBILITY = NOT ESTABLISHED`. Defer canonical evaluation to Human Governance.

## 4. Discrete Forensic Verdict Scorecard

Record the results produced by the canonical verification suite (`verify_g7_evidence.sh`):

| Audit Dimension | Permitted Verdicts | Criteria for PASS / ELIGIBLE | Current Audit Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Runtime Continuity** | `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNRESOLVED` | Continuous duration $\ge 21,600$s; `RestartCount == 0`; `OOMKilled == false`; zero crashes. | `[PENDING RUN COMPLETION]` |
| **2. Feed Continuity** | `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNRESOLVED` | Zero unrecovered disconnects; terminal feed state connected or cleanly completed; cadence verified. | `[PENDING RUN COMPLETION]` |
| **3. Evidence Integrity** | `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNRESOLVED` | Journal, Manifest, Snapshots non-empty; chained SHA-256 hashes verify; non-root permissions. | `[PENDING RUN COMPLETION]` |
| **4. Harness Session Binding** | `PASS` / `FAIL` / `UNRESOLVED` | Harness resolved and tracked the exact active runtime session ID throughout execution. | `[PENDING RUN COMPLETION]` |
| **5. Canonical Eligibility** | `VERIFIER-REPORTED ELIGIBLE` / `VERIFIER-REPORTED NOT ELIGIBLE` / `NOT ESTABLISHED` / `REQUIRES GOVERNANCE REVIEW` | Recorded from the canonical verifier / governance contract applicable to the exact source version that launched the run. This checklist does not independently create, add, remove, reinterpret, or retroactively change G7 acceptance criteria. | `[NOT ESTABLISHED]` |
| **6. Stage 11 (S11) Gate** | `CLOSED` / `OPEN` | Qualifying continuous run outputs `CLOSED`; operator-recovered or interrupted run outputs `OPEN`. | `[OPEN — PENDING AUDIT]` |
